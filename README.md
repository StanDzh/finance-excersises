A small collection of notes and whatnot ;)

Assembled in the form of notes and python code, after studying the lovely [Secrets of Trading Stock](https://www.ozon.ru/product/sekrety-birzhevoy-torgovli-torgovlya-aktsiyami-na-fondovyh-birzhah-7347188/?sh=dR_iFGXr)

### Requirements

 * Python > 3.8
 * Willingness to look into someone else's notes (??)

### Usage

First of all, you'll need to set up the environment:
```
make env && .env/bin/activate
```

After that, feel free to go wild ;)
Hint: see `Makefile` for other targets
